	  %\section{EXPERIENCE}
		  %{\bf Software Development Engineer-Intern }\hfill {\it 2012-Summer } \\
		  %{\it Amazon.com,Chennai }
	\section{PROJECTS}
		{\bf An Improved PSO Algorithm for Solving TSP with Edge Recombination Operator}\hfill {\it 2014}\\
		We modified discrete-PSO algorithm proposed for solving TSP, with the use of edge recombination operator for redefining the dependant moves in PSO. The new algorithm showed significantly better performance than the edge recombination crossover based GA, in terms of convergence rate and quality of solutions for benchmark problems from TSPLIB.

	    {\bf Machine Parsable RESTfull web API }\hfill {\it 2013}\\
	    A RESTful web API is a web API implemented using {\it HTTP }and the principles of {\it REST(Representational State Transfer)}. By using  a {\it Microformats }-like grammar that helps to annotate semantics into the already existing documentation of REST services doubling them as machine-readable descriptions. Moreover, these basic annotations help to link between RESTful services in the same domain and enable automatic discovery and composition(creating {\it Mashups}).

        {\bf Graphical Interface to manage BOINC projects}\hfill {\it 2011}\\
		We implemented a graphical interface in Java to control BOINC server and to allow easy deployment of BOINC apps and work units.
